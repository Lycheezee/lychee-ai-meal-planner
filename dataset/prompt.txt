Create a KNN training model for D:\Code\Lychee\lychee-meal-planners\systems\dataset\daily_food_nutrition_dataset_cleaned.csv
The target is to find the most similar food base on the top 4 important nutrition features


2. Find the important feature using PCA, Random Forest and Mutual Information & Variance Analysis
3. Prepare the dataset base on top 4 feature
4. Using ScalarStandard() to standarize the dataset
5. Prepare these models and fit all the dataset for KNN with (don't train, just fit for KNN):
metric: euclidean, manhattan, minkowski, cosine, Chebyshev
N_neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15
weight: uniform, distance
5. Add a test case that user input 6 random ids from the dataset, find 6 most similar food to each of them
